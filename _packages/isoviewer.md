The isoviewer graphical user interface (GUI) provided by this package is based on the functionlity implemented by the isoreader and isoprocessor packages. The purpose of the GUI is two fold. First and foremost, it is a learning tool to illustrate how to build literate RMarkdown data processing files for IRMS data using the underlying packages as a unified interface for reading, converting and quickly visualizing various raw IRMS data file formats. The second purpose is to provide an example for a web-based IRMS data repository that is easy to run on any computer/server completely platform-independent and open-source. Towards this goal, the isoviewer package provides some rudimentary GUI modules that can be used in other more customized applications.

FIXME
<p><span class="fa fa-rocket"></span>: An online demo of the isoviewer GUI is <a href="https://www.kopflab.org/isoviewer_demo">available on our server</a> but has limited computational resources (i.e. could be slow).</p>
